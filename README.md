# ecdsa-demo
This code snippet demonstrates how to sign data and verify the signature using ECDSA algorithm and BouncyCastle library. 
## How to run
- Execute
```
dotnet build
dotnet run
```
- The snippet will create a file license.txt with signed data by a private key.
- This file will contain data and signature
- The method `ReadLicenseFromFile()` then will read the license.txt file and verify data using a public key.
